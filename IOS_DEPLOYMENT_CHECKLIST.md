## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known iOS Limitations

### 1. Emergency Detection
- iOS doesn't allow direct power button monitoring like Android
- Alternative methods implemented:
  - Volume button detection
  - App state monitoring
  - Shake gesture (can be added)

### 2. SMS Functionality
- iOS restricts programmatic SMS sending
- Implementation opens native Messages app with pre-filled content
- User must manually send the message

### 3. Background Processing
- iOS has strict background processing limitations
- Emergency services work best when app is active
- Background location requires "Always" permission

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Pod Install Fails**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod deintegrate
   pod install
   ```

2. **Signing Issues**
   - Verify Apple Developer account status
   - Check provisioning profiles in Xcode
   - Ensure bundle ID matches

3. **Firebase Connection Issues**
   - Verify GoogleService-Info.plist is in project
   - Check Firebase project configuration
   - Ensure iOS app is properly configured in Firebase Console

4. **Build Errors**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   flutter build ios
   ```

5. **Emergency Features Not Working**
   - Check iOS permissions in Settings app
   - Verify emergency contacts are configured
